# DBConnections

DBConnections is a PHP library designed to simplify database connections by providing a unified structure and logic 
for connecting to different types of databases. It allows developers to connect to multiple databases using the same consistent approach, 
making integration easier and more efficient.

Currently, the library supports connections to the following databases:
* **MySQL**
* **PostgreSQL**

Future updates may include support for additional database systems.
